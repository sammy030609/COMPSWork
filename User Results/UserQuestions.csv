"all star players, players that are good for their position","total points scored, high rebounds and assist numbers","Yes","draft a star for the first round that will guarantee me many fantasy points. Look for good role players once the stars are all picked","graphs with dots everywhere or bar like graphs"
"I like drafting players that fill the stat sheet with points, rebounds, assists","higher points per game ","No","Look at last years point totals for inspiration of who to draft
pick all star players that score","graphs that show a difference between players scoring"
"I look for players with high scoring games, players that are allstars, players that gets multiple stats of each category","I look for players that get blocks and assists especially if the league has high points for those","No","I would draft a top ten player in the league like Giannis or Steph in the first round, then after I would draft starting players that have a high impact, then after I would draft role players that don't score as much but get rebounds or assists","a graph that would be easy to view sports stats is a scatter plot with dots that represent players"
"The players I like to draft are players that dont lose too many fantasy points
I also like drafting players that are all stars or score a lot","players with high points or numbers in mutiple categories","Yes","to start the draft I would choose a player that scores a lot in the league like jokic or embid because they get a lot of points
for the rest of the draft, try to get players that also score a lot each round","idk"
"impactful players in the league that score and statpad or have lots of stats in every category","a player that has stats in every category kinda like draymon green","No","pick a star player from a team in the first round, then try to get a second best player once all the best players from each team are taken","graphs that make it easy to show who scores more in each category"
"players that will score a lot and also get other stats because in fantasy that makes a difference","whatever stats make the most fantasy points based on the league","No","drafting a player that is really good (Luka, giannis, lebron) early in the draft then draft role players that will still make a positive impact on my team. Make sure to not draft too many players in one position ","something that will show me which players are most scoring than others "
"For drafting, I would pick players that score a ton of points but also pick players that get stats all the way around. These players can be like Jokic since he scores and gets rebounds, blocks and assists","High in points scored per game, blocks, steals, assists, I consider everything","No","Looking for players that are superstars like Jokic that I mentioned and that fill every stat category. Once those players are taken selecting good role players or players that get a lot of each stat would be next priority","I guess a graph/plot that you differentiate player's statstics with other player's statstics"
"I guess the players I look for are players that are popular and that I know are good","Maybe points that are scored","No","I like to draft the popular players first that I know are good
After that drafting players that have a higher point total based on the projections of the app","Probably a graph that shows how much players score in fantasy"
"When drafting I pick people that would get lots of points assists and blocks in every game kinda like a big man that can shoot and do everything else","blocks and pts","No","Draft a big man all star center because they gain a ton of fantasy points
Next draft a guard all star
After that draft good players that could be role players but contriubte to the team and play a lot","show the difference between players of different positions"
