"Was Drafting the players positive or negative based on what the graphs produced when comparing fantasy stats?","How was your experience using the web app to draft players?","Was it easy to view which players scored more points?","What would you do differently using my project
for influencing your decision on who to draft?","What kind of stats did you compare
and was it was impactful on your choice of drafting?","Any other comments?"
"2","2","2","I guess I would look at the negative and positive points graph more to see which players score a lot of points but has a lot of negative points that make the total go down. Seeing what players have more negative points can influence me to pick players that don't get too many negative fantasy points","I tried to compare the total fantasy points stats with other players but it was hard to use the app because of how you could not search names. The fantasy draft time is very short and I don't have enough time to go searching for a player. The one graph can break down all the categories of stats but there was also not enough time while drafting","This web app has a good start but the lack of no player search made it harder to find players and compare them. I think it would be useful if you had time before the draft to scout players instead of doing it while drafting."
"4","3","4","Something that I would do differently would be to look at the graph that shows how much a fantasy player scores in each category. This allows me to find players that could score more and how they may be a role player that has a big fantasy impact","I mostly compared the total fantasy points stats between the players. It was easy using that graph because it just gave you a point total. Drafting was hard when using this app because of how you have little time to pick a player and you only get more time to research while other players are drafting. I also think not having a way to search players makes it hard","Having a way to compare players side by side or highlighting players points on a graph could make a big difference"
"4","4","4","having the graph that can compare the categories of stats would be useful to me for future drafting
If i had time to use this project before I draft and find players that could score a lot would help me draft big time","Mostly looked at the graph that compared the fantasy points with points scored and helped me see if a player that scores a lot actually get more fantasy points which isn't the case
it definitely helped me find some players that I didn't know could score that many fantasy points","The graphs were definitely helpful with comparing players visually like you said"
"2","1","3","Doing more research on players that can gain lots of points. Not having time to search for a player while drafting made it difficult to compare. I need more time to do some searching for good fantasy players.","The only think I compared was looking at the graph that shows the different positions in a different color and then I used the chart. looking at all the fantasy data in the chart helped towards the end of the drafting because finding the players was hard on the graph. ","I would need something to help me find certain players that I'm looking for. I like the idea of the graph helping compare players and their stats but its hard when you can't single out the stat and where it is on the graph"
"3","3","4","I think knowing which graphs to utilze to find fantasy players worth is important especially using the graphs that show the negative points. Maybe if I had more time before the draft and write out which players looked good and are underrated I could use that knowledge for my drafting","Looking at the chart of data helped to see the totals of the fantasy players but I liked using the graph where you can select different categories and see which players score more in it. Also being able to see negative stats was very useful",""
"4","4","5","I would definitely consider using all the graphs at some point in the drafting process to find players that score in stats that aren't just point per game. Trying to find players that get a bunch of points from stats like blocks and steals would benefit my team and my decision","I tried to compare the total points stats and the players mostly when drafting","Seeing the different ways the stats are shown was useful even though I couldnt search for someone I wanted. I think taking note of what players you see are looking good on the graph and writing them down as you draft is useful"
